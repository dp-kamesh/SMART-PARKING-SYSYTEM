# SMART-PARKING-SYSYTEM
A Smart Parking System powered by IoT (Internet of Things) revolutionizes 
traditional parking management, offering a seamless, efficient, and user
friendly experience. Leveraging cutting-edge technology, it transforms the 
way we interact with parking spaces, optimizing utilization, reducing 
congestion, and enhancing convenience for both drivers and parking lot 
operators. 
 At its core, this system integrates various IoT devices such as sensors, 
cameras, and connectivity modules to monitor and manage parking spaces 
in real-time. These sensors detect the presence or absence of vehicles, 
transmitting data to a centralized platform via the internet. Through 
advanced algorithms and data analytics, the system provides valuable 
insights into parking space availability, occupancy patterns, and usage 
trends. 
 
Key Components: 
• ESP32 microcontroller: The ESP32 is the brain of the system. It's a 
powerful, low-cost, and Wi-Fi enabled microcontroller that can be 
programmed to read data from sensors, control outputs, and 
communicate with a network. 
 
• Sensors: Sensors are used to detect the presence or absence of a vehicle in 
a parking space. Common sensor options include: 
▪ Infrared (IR) sensors: IR sensors emit infrared light and detect reflected light. They can be used to detect if a vehicle is blocking the sensor's beam. 
•  Actuators: Actuators are used to control physical elements of the parking system based on the data from the sensors. Examples of actuators include: 
• Servo motors: These motors can be used to control a barrier gate at the entrance/exit of the parking lot. 
• LED lights: LED lights can be used to indicate the availability of a parking space (e.g., green for vacant, red for occupied). 
• Communication Module (Optional): An additional communication module like an Ethernet shield or LoRa module can be used to connect the ESP32 to the cloud or a local server for data logging, visualization, and integration with mobile applications.  
• Power Supply: The entire system will need a power supply to operate. This can be a wall adapter, a battery pack, or even solar panels for a more eco-friendly solution.
